==3.0b22 (2009-11-01)==
  * Includes OpenVPN version 2.1_rc20, which fixes problems with the "redirect-gateway" option.
  * Includes the 32/64-bit version of tuntap, which fixes problems running Tunnelblick on Snow Leopard under the 64-bit kernel. Thanks to the tuntap project, to Mohammad A. Haque for Xcode help, and to Jean-Philippe Jung for testing.
  * Stores username in Keychain instead of preferences.
  * Stores shadow copies of configuration files in /Library/Application Support/Tunnelblick/Users/_username_ instead of /Library/Tunnelblick/_username_.
  * Bug fixes: Fixes bugs that interfere with storage or retrieval of usernames and passwords. Adds new configs to OpenVPN Log window when it has been opened but is currently closed. Clears "Automatically launch Tunnelblick upon login" for error exits. Clean exit if 'running from .dmg' error. Fixes several memory and CF leaks. Fixes bug that caused attempt to kill openvpn process that had already been killed. Fixes potential problem detecting locked configuration files during shadow copying. Installer detects and reports errors making ownership and permission modifications.
  * Enhancement: Creates openvpn-down-root.so and puts a copy of it in Tunnelblick.app/Contents/Resources, allowing use of OpenVPN 'user' and 'group' options by adding a line to the configuration file. See the [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/UsingTunnelblick Using Tunnelblick] wiki for details.
  * Deployment enhancements: Several changes have been made which make it easy to create a customized version of Tunnelblick that can easily be deployed to multiple clients or installed once for all users of a computer. Configuration, key, and certificate files and up/down scripts can be put into a Deploy folder within Tunnelblick.app, and Tunnelblick will use them instead of using files in ~/Library/openvpn. These files are read-only, and, combined with read-only preference overrides, can create a tamper-proof application. Such deployed applications may be updated via the automatic update mechanism without losing the configuration information. Detailed information is available in the [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/DeployingTunnelblick Deploying Tunnelblick] wiki.
  * Other enhancements: Clarifies language in a few places. Adds a specific error message if unrecoverable error. Warns if all config files removed and gives a choice of quitting or installing and editing a sample config file. Warns if zero-length passphrase, username, or password. Adds Tunnelblick icon and the configuration name to all applicable dialog windows. Puts dialogs on top of other windows. 

Known Issues:
  * The standard scripts that "Set nameserver" uses handle DNS for most common setups. You must use custom scripts to do anything else. See the [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/UsingTunnelblick "Using Tunnelblick" wiki] for details.
  * Localization is not complete.

==3.0b20 (2009-10-09)==
  * Fixes issues with "Set nameserver" on Snow Leopard.
  * Inhibits console message that tun and tap are already loaded.
  * Sends details of some error messages to the OpenVPN log window instead of the Console log.
  * Prefixes all non-OpenVPN messages in the log window with "`*`Tunnelblick:".

Known Issues:
  * Does not work under Snow Leopard when booted into 64-bit mode. (Works when booted into 32-bit mode.)
  * The "--redirect-gateway" OpenVPN option fails silently, causing incorrect routing, if no flags are specified (which is a syntax error). Previously, a flag of "def1" was assumed.
  * Localization is not complete.
  * The standard scripts that "Set nameserver" uses handle DNS for most common setups. You must use custom scripts to do anything else. See the [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/UsingTunnelblick "Using Tunnelblick" wiki] for details.

==3.0b18 (2009-09-23)==
  * Implements different behavior when configuration files change: when a configuration file is added, all connections are maintained. When a configuration file is deleted, only the corresponding connection is disconnected (and an alert window is displayed). In either case, the menu and Log window reflect the change immediately without restarting Tunnelblick. Changes to a configuration file's contents or metadata are ignored (but will be used the next time a connection is attempted).
  * Works with home folders on network volumes and/or when the home folder is not permitted to have files owned by root. This is implemented transparently with "shadow" copies of configuration files. It is automatic if the config file is on a network volume or if Tunnelblick's "useShadowConfigurationFiles" preference is set.
  * Moves "Set nameserver" checkbox to avoid inadvertent changes.
  * Fixes issues when DNS is set manually, when 'dhcp-option DOMAIN ...' is pushed to the client, and when --remote-random is used under certain circumstances.
  * Fixes misleading language in window that requests a username/password for the VPN.
  * Fixes a bug which caused OpenVPN Log window to stay on top of all other windows if it was opened within 3 seconds of starting Tunnelblick.
  * Fixes a bug which caused config file changes to be ignored under certain circumstances.
  * Fixes a bug which interferes with saving a username/password combination or a passphrase to the Keychain when there is more than one simultaneous connection.
  * Fixes a bug which causes a (quitable) infinite loop if an error occurred while changing ownerships and/or permissions.
  * Fixes a bug which sometimes causes non-English text of buttons or checkboxes to be truncated or clipped.
  * Makes changes to ownership and permissions of parts of Tunnelblick.app for better security.
  * Adds support for WINS configurations from the server when using the standard up/down scripts (i.e., when the "Set nameserver" checkbox is checked).
  * Warns about multiple simultaneous connections, with a checkbox to suppress such warnings.
  * Displays duration times only for connected tunnels.
  * Updated to UKKQueue 0.5 and LZO 2.03
  * Adds Spanish localization (thanks to Diego Rivera).

Known Issues:
  * Does not work under Snow Leopard when booted into 64-bit mode. (Works when booted into 32-bit mode.)
  * The "--redirect-gateway" OpenVPN option fails silently, causing incorrect routing, if no flags are specified (which is a syntax error). Previously, a flag of "def1" was assumed.
  * Localization is not complete for French, German, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, or Spanish.
  * The standard scripts that "Set nameserver" uses handle DNS for most common setups. You must use custom scripts to do anything else. See the [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/UsingTunnelblick "Using Tunnelblick" wiki] for details.

==3.0b16 (2009-08-22)==

  * Upgraded to OpenVPN version 2.1_rc19
  * Additional French translations (contributed by Oliver Hill)
  * An entry is appended to the OpenVPN Log window if OpenVPN returns with an error code. (This typically happens when there is an error in the configuration file.)

Known Issues:
  * Home folders cannot reside on remote volumes (AFS, NFS, etc.)
  * Japanese and Norwegian localization is not complete.
  * The standard scripts that "Set nameserver" uses handle DNS for the most common DHCP setups. You must use custom scripts to do anything else. The standard scripts:
      * Do not support multiple simultaneous connections
      * Do not support multiple nameservers for multiple domains (e.g., local nameserver and remote nameserver simultaneously)
      * Do not remove manual DNS entries (i.e., the manual nameserver will continue to be used even when the tunnel is open even if the OpenVPN "redirect-gateway" option is specified)

==3.0b14 (2009-08-10)==

  * Fixed issues where DNS settings were not saved properly, and when DHCP is renewed (contributed by Diego Rivera)
  * Added support for PKCS#11 and Security Tokens, e.g. Aladdin eToken (contributed by Xaver Loppenstedt)
  * Additional Korean and German translations (contributed by Markus Schneider and Kyoungmin Kim)
  * Animation improvements, including the ability to have "icon sets" (contributed by Raal Goff). Note: the user interface for this feature is not included yet
  * Fixed issue with "Set nameserver" and "Auto connect on launch" checkboxes being cleared on quit if the "OpenVPN Log" window was never displayed
  * Fixed issue which caused disconnects when any file in ~/Library/openvpn was accessed (for example, by backup software). (Note that changing, adding, or deleting any configuration files will close all open connections)
  * Fixed issue with failed authentication: now handled gracefully: allows cancel or retry. If credentials are stored in the KeyChain, also allows retry with new credentials (by deleting the old credentials before the retry)
  * Fixed issue with multiple connections with same username; separate passwords are now kept for each username
  * Fixed issue in dialog about configuration files - the correct path is now shown: "~/Library" instead of "/Library"
  * Command-C, Command-X, Command-V (copy, cut, paste) and Command-A, Command-M, Command-W, and Command-Q (select all, minimize to the Dock, close window, and quit Tunnelblick) now work properly from the "OpenVPN Log" window
  * Fixed issue which caused invalid dates/times to appear in the OpenVPN Log
  * Shows connection duration in "OpenVPN Log" window's tabs

  * Displays tab for the left-most established connection when the "OpenVPN Log" window is first displayed. If no established connection exists, displays the left-most tab
  * Added the "Using Tunnelblick.html" document to the installation disk image
  * Added preference, "doNotMonitorConfigurationFolder" (default = False) to disable monitoring of the configuration folder for changes to the configuration files
  * Added preference, "placeIconInStandardPositionInStatusBar" (default = False) to have the Tunnelblick icon placed normally in the Status Bar -- to the left of other items (contributed by Raal Goff and Michael Schloh von Bennewitz) 
  * Added an "About" window that displays a link to the website, Tunnelblick version and build numbers, and the OpenVPN version number, which is dynamically extracted from the openvpn program (and thus always reports the version of OpenVPN which is actually being used).
  * Fixed issue which caused Tunnelblick to pass the "script-security 2" arguments to OpenVPN even if a version of OpenVPN which doesn't support that argument is being used
  * openvpnstart enhancements:
      * The "Set nameserver" argument is now optional and defaults to 0 (NO)
      * Optional argument skips passing the "script-security 2" arguments to OpenVPN.
      * Improved error checking and reporting
      * Displays usage instructions if invoked with no arguments
      * Fixed program crashes caused by improper syntax
