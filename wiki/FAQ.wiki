=Where is the documentation?=
The newest disk images (version 3.0b12 and later) include release notes and an HTML document, "Using Tunnelblick", which provide extensive documentation on using Tunnelblick. This document and others are also available on the Tunnelblick Discussion Group, http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss, in the "Pages" section.

=How do I install Tunnelblick?=
Download the latest disk image from the featured downloads section on the project page. Mount it and drag the Tunnelblick.app icon to the shortcut to the Applications folder, or any other location on your local hard disk.

=How do I uninstall Tunnelblick?=
Simply move the Tunnelblick.app icon to the trash. There are no other files installed into the system except for preferences and OpenVPN configuration files (see "Using Tunnelblick" for more information on these files). The tun/tap kernel extensions are contained within the .app package and will be loaded only when needed directly from there.

=Why does Tunnelblick need root privileges?=
OpenVPN needs root privileges because it needs to modify network settings like configuring new network devices, changing routes, adding and removing nameservers. Because we don't want you to enter your account password every time you start a VPN connection, Tunnelblick comes with a setuid root binary that allows you to do exactly one thing: start a VPN connection with super user rights. That's why Tunnelblick needs your password on its first start after installation.

=Why does Tunnelblick change the ownership of the configuration files to root?=
This is a security issue. OpenVPN config files allow you to specify up/down scripts which will be executed with root privileges every time a VPN connection is started or stopped. If the configuration files were owned by the local user, anyone could execute arbitrary code as root by inserting an 'up' directive to the config file and pointing it to a (malicious) shell script. Therefore, on the first run, Tunnelblick changes the ownership of the config file to root, so it is protected against unnoticed and possibly malicious changes.

=Help! My routes are not restored when closing my VPN connection. What is happening?=
You are most probably using the 'user' or 'group' directive in your OpenVPN client configuration file. If you use it, the OpenVPN process will drop privileges after startup which is nice as additional security measure. However, OpenVPN needs root privileges for restoring the route back to their original state. In short: don't use it.

=Why does Tunnelblick use OpenVPN version 2.1, which is not an official release?=
Tunnelblick uses OpenVPN version 2.1, instead of version 2.0.9, which is the latest official release, because that is the version recommended by the OpenVPN core team.

=Where can I go if my question is not answered here?=
