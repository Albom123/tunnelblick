You don't need any other programs to use Tunnelblick. It comes with the OpenVPN program and all required drivers built into the Tunnelblick application itself.

However, you do need access to a VPN server. Your computer is one end of the VPN tunnel and the VPN server is the other end. There are several ways to get access to a VPN server:

  * Your employer may provide a VPN server so you can work from home or the road securely.
  * You can set up your own VPN server at home, and use it to access your home network and the Internet securely when at a remote location. The VPN server could be a program running on a Mac, Windows, or Linux computer, or on your home router.
  * You can get (free or for a fee) access to a VPN by using a VPN service provider.
