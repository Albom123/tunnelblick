All versions of Tunnelblick allow use of OpenVPN as a server, but before Tunnelblick version 3.1beta02:
 * Tunnelblick could only start the OpenVPN server when a user was logged in and launched Tunnelblick; and
 * When the user quit Tunnelblick or logged out, the OpenVPN server would be shut down.

Tunnelblick version 3.1beta02 and higher are much more flexible:
 * The OpenVPN server can be started when the computer starts and will keep running until the computer shuts down.
 * Tunnelblick may be used to start or stop the OpenVPN server or to edit the configuration file.
