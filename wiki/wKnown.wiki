*PLEASE* discuss any problems on the [http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss Tunnelblick Discussion List].

The following are known problems or limitations in Tunnelblick version 3.0:
  * If "Monitor connection" is checked, Tunnelblick monitors the network interface that connects to the VPN and will restart the connection if changes to DNS or WINS are detected. With some network configurations this causes repeated disconnects/reconnects every few seconds. To avoid this, uncheck "Monitor connection" in the tab for the problematic configuration on the "Details..." window..

  * The standard scripts that "Set nameserver" uses handle DNS for most common setups. You must use custom scripts to do anything else. See [wConfigT#The_%22Set_Nameserver%22_Check_Box_and_DNS_&_WINS_Sett Seting up Configurations] for details.

  * Tunnelblick does not implement pushing domain information from the server (only DNS and WINS information).

  * Tunnelblick only implements the hash algorithms that are available on OS X 10.4 ("Tiger"), even when it is running on OS X 10.5 or 10.6.

  * When attempting to connect to a VPN, Tunnelblick may fail to load tun.kext or tap.kext. This can happen when another program, or another version of Tunnelblick, has loaded different versions of tun.kext and tap.kext. For example, the Cisco VPN client loads conflicting kexts at system startup, and they must be unloaded for Tunnelblick to work. Viscosity loads tun.kext and tap.kext when it is running. This problem may be avoided (for Viscosity) by quitting Viscosity, or (for Cisco) by using the [DownloadsEntry#User-Contributed_Scripts user-contributed script] designed for that purpose.

  * If "Set nameserver" is checked, all "up" and "down" options in the OpenVPN configuration file will be ignored. To work around this, include appropriate parts of the standard up/down scripts in your own scripts and do not check "Set nameserver". (The reason for this is that OpenVPN's "down-pre" option cannot be used with the standard "Set nameserver" down script, but may be used by custom scripts, so the two scripts cannot be used together.)

  * Updates will fail if the name of Tunnelblick is not "Tunnelblick" or "Tunnelblick.app". To avoid this, rename the application temporarily, perform the update, then restore the original name. (You must change the name of the application itself, not the name of an alias or shortcut to the application.)

  * Localization is not complete. We need additional translations to German, Catalan, Chinese (both simplified and traditional), Spanish, French, Korean, Japanese, and Norwegian (Norsk Bokmål). If you can help with these or any other languages, please contact [http://code.google.com/u/jkbullard/ Jon].
