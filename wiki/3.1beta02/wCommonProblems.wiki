==Tunnelblick Won't Connect==
If Tunnelblick won't connect to a VPN, take a look at the [wOpenVPNLog The OpenVPN Log], which usually indicates what specifically is causing the problem. Unfortunately, the OpenVPN log usually has a lot of entries as it makes a connection attempt, and it is sometimes hard to find the entry that describes the problem. Usually it is one of the last entries in the log, however.

==An error messages says to see details in the Console Log==
See [wConsoleLog The Console Log] for instructions on viewing the Console Log.

==An error message says "Tunnelblick could not be launched because of a problem with the configuration. Please examine the Console Log for details."==
(See [wConsoleLog The Console Log] for instructions on viewing the Console Log.)

This is usually caused by a problem with the private configuration folder. (Tunnelblick sets this up, but if you accidentally delete a critical file or folder, this could happen.) The Console log will contain details about the specific problem.

See [wFileLocations File Locations] for information about how the files and folders should be set up.
