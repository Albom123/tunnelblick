The following are known problems or limitations in Tunnelblick version 3.0b24:

  * The standard scripts that "Set nameserver" uses handle DNS for most common setups. You must use custom scripts to do anything else. See [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/wiki/UsingTunnelblick the Using Tunnelblick wiki] for details.

  * When attempting to connect to a VPN, Tunnelblick may fail to load tun.kext and tap.kext. This can happen when another program, or another version of Tunnelblick, has loaded different versions of tun.kext and tap.kext. For example, the Cisco VPN client loads tun.kext and tap.kext at system startup, and they must be unloaded for Tunnelblick to work. Viscosity loads tun.kext and tap.kext when it is running. This problem may be avoided (for Viscosity) by quitting Viscosity, or (for Cisco) by entering the following command:
{{{
  sudo /System/Library/StartupItems/CiscoTUN stop 
}}}
  * Localization is not complete. We need additional translations to Catalan, German, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, and Norwegian (Norsk Bokmål). If you can help with these or any other languages, please contact project committer  [http://code.google.com/u/jkbullard/ Jon].
