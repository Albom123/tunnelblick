*2010-05-27*: Tunnelblick 3.1beta04 is available on the <font color="red">*[wBeta Beta Releases page]*</font>.

This is mainly a bug-fix release, but there are some new features:

  * The pipes for script output to OpenVPN log window are created on demand instead of when Tunnelblick launches, so if you have 50 configurations, Tunnelblick won't create 50 pipes when launched.

  * A DHCP renew which restores the original DNS and/or WINS information no longer causes the connection to restart. This new behavior can reversed be by setting Tunnelblick the boolean preferences '-doNotRestoreOnDnsReset' and/or '-doNotRestoreOnWinsReset' to TRUE.

  * The up, down, and leasewatch scripts have been modified to implement options for the scripts which Tunnelblick causes OpenVPN to put first (before OpenVPN parameters) in the command line which starts the up/down scripts.

The full list of changes is in the [wRlsNotes Release Notes].

*2010-05-14*: Tunnelblick 3.1beta02 is available on the <font color="red">*[wBeta Beta Releases page]*</font>.

The full list of changes is in the [wRlsNotes Release Notes].

New features include:

 * *Tunnelblick VPN Configurations*: All of the files associated with one configuration may be collected together and put into a Tunnelblick VPN Configuration. Tunnelblick VPN Configurations include features such as version control that make them easy to use for distribution to multiple Tunnelblick users.

 * *Shared configurations*: Tunnelblick VPN Configurations may be shared by all users of a computer without being installed for each user individually. A button on the "Detailsâ€¦" window switches a configuration from Shared to Private or Private to Shared.

 * *Connect when computer starts*: Shared and Deployed Tunnelblick VPN Configurations may be set to automatically connect when the computer starts, before anyone is logged in. Such connections can persist through login and logout and may be controlled by Tunnelblick when a user is logged in.

 * *Tunnelblick deals with the .tun and .tap kexts more flexibly*.
