Before *posting a new* Issue, please

  * Take a look at the [KnownIssues Known Issues wiki].
  * Discuss the problem in the [http://groups.google.com/group/tunnelblick-discuss Tunnelblick Discussion Group]. More people monitor the discussion group and you will probably receive help more quickly there than if you post an Issue.

No, I really want to go to [http://code.google.com/p/tunnelblick/issues/list Tunnelblick Issues].
