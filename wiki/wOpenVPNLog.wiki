The OpenVPN log is the record of output from OpenVPN for a connection. It also includes entries from Tunnelblick giving additional information.

You can view the OpenVPN log for a connection by clicking on the Tunnelblick icon at the top of the screen, clicking "Detailsâ€¦", and selecting the tab for the configuration.

The level of detail in the log is controlled by OpenVPN's "verb" option.

Tunnelblick adds the following information to the OpenVPN log:
 * When started or when the log is cleared, Tunnelblick adds a line with the version of OS X, Tunnelblick, and OpenVPN.
 * When Tunnelblick attempts to connect, Tunnelblick adds two lines: a line with the command-line which it used to run the "openvpnstart" program, and the line that openvpnstart used to run OpenVPN itself.

You may use the standard keyboard shortcuts when viewing the OpenVPN log: 
||Command-C||Copy||
||Command-X||Cut||
||Command-V||Paste||
||Command-A||Select all the text in the log||
||Command-M||Minimize the window to the dock||
||Command-W||Close the window||
||Command-Q||Quit Tunnelblick||
